(9) - Two cock compatibility
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Do you have a Premium Second Life account and able to wear two animesh products? Now you can wear two cocks at the same time and animate them separately from one another!
~Can now wear two cocks and control them with the hud!
Step 1
    ~Wear 1 copy of your bits and type in the following code below:
       /55 bits,-1
    ~This command will set your bits to run on channel -55
Step 2
    ~Your hud now needs to be enabled to show extra tools type in the following command whiles wearing your Hud
     /552 EnableHud
    ~That will refresh the hud and close it. Opening the hud you will now see a new tab with the following buttons
    ~~Bits1  -This controls the original cock that runs on channel /55
    ~~Bits2  -This controls the second cock that runs on channel /-55
    ~~Both  -Controls both cocks at the same time.  Sends out messages in both channels
    
To undo these edits!
    /-55 bits,1
    ~will restore your cocks channel to default /55 again!
    /552 DisableHud  
    ~Will remove the extra buttons once again.
    
    WARNING. Do not change your channels unless you wish 3rd party creations like (Its not Mine) to stop functioning!
    ~~This command is only for those who ends up wanting to wear two penises and wants them to function separately from one-another     
    Q- Why can't i simply set my own custom channel?
    A- To preserve compatibility if another cum system wishes to make use of a second penis. Cool for avatars who has two penises but each cock has its own cum color... 
         this way modders of such body cum systems can play around with these options!
         
NOTE: "Records Customization v1 (Records edit while worn)"  
            Can only record information from channel 55 so your second cock that will run on negative 55 will not count into this recorder!

Following particles below can be forced to have different effects as the following code shows:
NOTE: This will not permanently change your Cum Settings ... This below is meant to be used by toys or temporary cum affects!
~ParticleSize : between 0.0 to 3.0.  Can go pass 3 if you really want to >.>
~Glow: between 	0.0 - 1.0 Higher value is brighter.  
~Fullbright: 	0 disables 1 enables
~Constant/Non:  0 disables 1 enables.  Enabling this will result in endless cumming. Until user stops it.

/55 cum,<LsL Color>,ParticleSize,Glow,fullbright,Constant/Non

Example: /55 cum,<1,0,1>,2,0.03,1,1

The code explained above will work for cum/cumin/pee/peein
Or you can just use the code as shown below, It will use your built in colors that you can customize with your hud.
/55 cum
/55 cumin
/55 pee
/55 peein
/55 pre




◆Splattering Color inherits the color that was last present on your cock, So pee = to pee color .. cum = cum color.... If you where cleaned from the start....It will have a translucent white color
~~StartSpeed: handles in Seconds.  Less is Faster. (Faster)Min 0.2, (Slower)Max 5.9 
~~Timer: So if you want to make your Cock Splash every 2 seconds.
/55 splattering,StartSpeed,Timer  

Default:
/55 splattering, 1.0, 0.2
Example1: 
/55 splattering, 2.0, 1.9


/55 Constant       - Causes your Particles to never stop until you Press the Stop button.
/55 NoConstant     - Default Setting, Stops after a certain period 
/55 fbright,0           -  1 for fullbright 0 for none  Affects All Particles
/55 particlesize,1      - default cock =  1   75% bigger cock  = 1,6. Affects Overall size of all your particles.
/55 heat,1              -This turns on mist effect radiating from the cock when covered in cum or splatter effects.
/55 heat,-1   		-Disables Mist effect
/55 bust,1  -Causes your cum particles to stream out like a hose pipe.
/55 bust,0 - Disable it.

⚫Explanation for each section!⚫
~These Cannot have a empty value given.
~~~~Size :   
                    ▶Affects the Size of your particles 
                    ▶Do Note : /55 particlesize,1    Still affects overall Particle sizes.
                    ▶Default 1.0 ...Pre is still affected by overall cum size, but with its own scale being able to be edited       
~~~~Distance:
                    ▶Affects the how far your particles will go!
                    ▶Default is 1.0  ...Example: 0.5  will half the cum/pee distance. Value higher than 1.0 will increase the distance
~~~~Timer:
                    ▶Affects the duration to complete your pee/cum event.
                    ▶Default 1.0 ... Setting a value below 1 will make it go faster, Value above 1 will result in slower
~~~~Sleep:
                    ▶Mainly used in Cum events!
                    ▶Amount of particles being displayed / extend particles emission time.
                    ▶Default: 1.0
~~~~AmountTimesEjaculate:
                    ▶Mainly used in Cum events!
                    ▶Amount of times you'd ejaculate.
                    ▶Default: 6
                    ▶This also affects how many stages your balls will drain, So default being 6, it will drain your balls inflation by 6. But if you want it to drain less, use the DrainSkip on the hud to increase the number of times it has to cum before it affects your balls.
~~~~TEXTURE
                    ▶Changes the texture. 
                    ▶Make copy of your bits before deciding to change your Textures of your particles!
~~~~StartScale/EndScale
                    ▶ Vectors scales works on a <X,Y,Z>  so scale your image/texture as you wish!
                    ▶ Example
                    ~~Start with a smaller vector like <0.080,0.250,0.0>
                    ~~End with a larger vector value like : <0.100,0.500,0.0>
~~~~MaxTrans/MinTrans:
                    ▶MaxTrans:0.99 ...but any value between 0.0 to 1.0 will work.
                    ▶MinTrans:0
~~~~ColorStart/ColorEnd:
                    ▶Supply LSLCOLOR here.
~~~~GlowStart/GlowEnd:
                    ▶Float Value between 0 - 1 can be given. Example 0.02
~~~~MaxAge:
                    ▶Numeric value to be given here example ... 1  or 2 or 3 or 10
                    ▶How long in sections your particles will be visible before they disappear    
~~~~Burstcount
                    ▶Numeric value to be given here example ... 1  or 2 or 3 or 10
                    ▶The amount of particles that spawns!
                    ▶ Leaving this section empty will ignore this section
~~~~Burstspeedmax/BurstpeedMin
                    ▶Affects mostly distance. The higher the float number the further the particles will shoot.
                    ▶Float number between  0 - 1.0 can be given
~~~~Accelerate:
                    ▶Vector has to be given here.
                    ▶Specifies a directional acceleration vector applied to each particle as it is emitted, in meters per second squared. Valid values are 0.0 to 100.0 for each direction both positive and negative, as region coordinates.                    
~~~~AngleStart/AngleEnd:            
                    ▶Float Value given here. 0 - 1
                    ▶Will cause particles to have a different angle when they get emitted.
                    
▶To Undo your changes to the particles. Please use the Hud >>>Extras >>> Particle Presets to get your particles set to default once more.  You can also put your own presets into the huds particle notecards!

▶skipnorm (Found at the very end of the Texture Applier command:
~Meant to ignore supplied normal maps on the base layers of the cock
~This can already be achieved if you removed the normal map from the texture command (But its destructive)
~~This is merely a toggle switch to make it easier to twitch on/off the normal maps without removing normalsUUID from your stored textures.
~~This creates a legacy feel which normals are only handled on another layer.
~Setting value to 1  means you disabled normals off your base mesh parts (Creates Legacy Effect)
~Setting value to 0  enables normals on the base mesh parts aswell (Creates deeper depth look)

█Command to apply gif animations to any part of the cock!

/506901 texanim1,Links,Modes,Faces,SizeX,SizeY,FrameStart,FrameEnd,Framerate

Can store upto 5 Slots
texanim1
texanim2
texanim3
texanim4
texanim5

~You can supply multiple links:
~for the Links slot you can supply links as follows:
7_26_19  //This example of targeting ObjectName 7 and 26 And 19. "_" used to separate links
~Same applies to Faces... if multiple links are given you need to supply their face numbers too.
2_-1_0    /// Here i supplied link 7 with face 2 .  Link 26 got -1 (affects all faces) And link 19 face is 0

~Prefered Object Names to use:
26   //Balls Tattoo
8    //Cock Tattoo
33   //Cock Barbs Tattoo


~Modes use the same "_" separator 
1  //ANIM_ON
2  //LOOP
4  //REVERSE
8  //PING_PONG
16  //SMOOTH  
32  //ROTATE  --Does not work with SCALE
64  //SCALE   --Does not work with ROTATE  Pick Either ROTATE/SCALE

Clears settings for "texanim1" slot.
/506901 texanim1,-1

Example of Command used for Lighting Tattoo Effect
/506901 texanim1,26,1_2,-1,3,3,0,9,12

*Deep Delve of my example above
It targets object name 26 //I only used ANIM_ON and LOOP // -1 for all faces //3 horizontal frames // 3 vertical frames //0 starting Frame// 9 last frame // 12 FrameRate

Example to Target only FrameRate:
/506901 texanim1,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,12


█NOTES:█
~DO NOT USE FRAMERATE 0 // This is warning from SL Wiki
~FRAMERATE is a float value so setting to 0.5 will slow down things
~If a slot is empty aka "texanim1"  and you try to do a FrameSpeed edit: /506901 texanim1,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,12  nothing will happen
~Make sure you even have a tattoo applied to even see your gif animations 
~~Following command you can use to simply replace your balls tattoo. Visit █Command for all customization for mesh parts. section of the hud for more texture code info.
